# Byte Displacement Mode

The byte displacement addressing mode is used to access the data pointed to by
a register with a signed byte offset. It is identified by byte values 0xA0
through 0xAF with the low nibble indicating the register. It is followed by the
(8-bit) byte-sized offset value.

When the register is PC (0xAF), it is called byte relative mode. It uses the
value of the PC register after it reads the operand and then adds the signed
byte offset. When represented in MACRO32 assembly language, the `(PC)` is
implied.

        MOVL    B^20(R0), R1            ; Byte Displacement Mode
        MOVL    B^-20, R2               ; Byte Relative Mode (uses PC)
```

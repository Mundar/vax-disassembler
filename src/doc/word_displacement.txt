# Word Displacement Mode

The word displacement addressing mode is used to access the data pointed to by
a register with a signed word offset. It is identified by word values 0xC0
through 0xCF with the low nibble indicating the register. It is followed by the
(16-bit) word-sized offset value.

When the register is PC (0xCF), it is called word relative mode. It uses the
value of the PC register after it reads the operand and then adds the signed
word offset. When represented in MACRO32 assembly language, the `(PC)` is
implied.

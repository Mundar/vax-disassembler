# Word Displacement Deferred Mode

The word displacement deferred addressing mode is used to access the data
pointed to by an address stored in memory pointed to by a register with a
signed word offset. It is identified by word values 0xD0 through 0xDF with the
low nibble indicating the register. It is followed by the (16-bit) word-sized
offset value.

When the register is PC (0xDF), it is called word relative deferred mode. It
uses the value of the PC register after it reads the operand and then adds the
signed word offset to point to the 32-bit pointer which it uses to access the
desired memory. When represented in MACRO32 assembly language, the `(PC)` is
implied.

```text
        ; The following instruction takes the pointer in R0 and adds 1420 to
        ; it. It then uses the 32-bit address stored at that location to
        ; access the 32-bit value and store it in R1.
        MOVL    @W^1420(R0), R1         ; Word Displacement Deferred Mode

        ; The following instruction takes the PC after it reads the `@W^-5220`,
        ; and then subracts 5220 from it. It then uses the 32-bit address stored
        ; at that location to access the 32-bit value and store it in R2.
        MOVL    @W^-5220, R2            ; Word Relative Deferred Mode (uses PC)

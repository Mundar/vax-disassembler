# Autoincrement Deferred Mode

The autoincrement deferred addressing mode uses the specified register as the
32-bit address of a pointer to memory to access a VAX data type, and then
increases the value in the register by 4 to point to the next 32-bit address.
It is identified by byte values 0x90 through 0x9E with the low nibble
indicating which register is used. 0x8F indicates the absolute addressing mode.

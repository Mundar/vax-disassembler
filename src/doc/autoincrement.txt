# Autoincrement Mode

The autoincrement addressing mode uses the specified register as a pointer to
memory to access the VAX data type, and then increases the value in the
register to point to the byte after the VAX data type. It is identified by byte
values 0x80 through 0x8E with the low nibble indicating which register is used.
0x8F indicates the immediate addressing mode.

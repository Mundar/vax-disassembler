# Longword Displacement Deferred Mode

The longword displacement deferred addressing mode is used to access the data
pointed to by an address stored in memory pointed to by a register with a
signed longword offset. It is identified by longword values 0xF0 through 0xFF with the
low nibble indicating the register. It is followed by the (32-bit) longword-sized
offset value.

When the register is PC (0xFF), it is called longword relative deferred mode. It
uses the value of the PC register after it reads the operand and then adds the
signed longword offset to point to the 32-bit pointer which it uses to access the
desired memory. When represented in MACRO32 assembly language, the `(PC)` is
implied.

```text
        ; The following instruction takes the pointer in R0 and adds 721420 to
        ; it. It then uses the 32-bit address stored at that location to access
        ; the 32-bit value and store it in R1.
        MOVL    @L^721420(R0), R1       ; Longword Displacement Deferred Mode

        ; The following instruction takes the PC after it reads the `@L^-89520`,
        ; and then subracts 89520 from it. It then uses the 32-bit address
        ; stored at that location to access the 32-bit value and store it in R2.
        MOVL    @L^-89520, R2           ; Longword Relative Deferred Mode (uses PC)

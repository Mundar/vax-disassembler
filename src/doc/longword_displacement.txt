# Longword Displacement Mode

The longword displacement addressing mode is used to access the data pointed to
by a register with a signed longword offset. It is identified by longword
values 0xE0 through 0xEF with the low nibble indicating the register. It is
followed by the (16-bit) longword-sized offset value.

When the register is PC (0xEF), it is called longword relative mode. It uses
the value of the PC register after it reads the operand and then adds the
signed longword offset. When represented in MACRO32 assembly language, the
`(PC)` is implied.
